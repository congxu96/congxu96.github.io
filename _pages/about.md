Hi, welcome to my homepage! I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [Physics Department, University of Texas at Austin](https://ph.utexas.edu/), working with Prof. [Carlos R. Baiz](https://baizgroup.org/). Previously, I received my B.S. at Physics in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) in 2018. 

## Research interest
- Ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy
- Image processing of 2D spectra
- Molecular dynamics simulations
- Self assemble behavior of artificial membrane

## Current research topic
- Dynamics Mode Decomposition (DMD) anaylsis of multidimensional spectra (submitted)
